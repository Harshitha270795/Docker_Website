               <p>Virtualization is the process of running a virtual instance of a computer system in a layer abstracted from the actual hardware. Most commonly, it refers to running multiple operating systems on a computer system simultaneously. To the applications running on top of the virtualized machine, it can appear as if they are on their own dedicated machine, where the operating system, libraries, and other programs are unique to the guest virtualized system and unconnected to the host operating system which sits below it.</p>
               <p>Virtualization uses software to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware that allows the hardware elements of a single computer—processors, memory, storage and more—to be divided into multiple virtual computers, commonly called virtual machines (VMs). Each VM runs its own operating system (OS) and behaves like an independent computer, even though it is running on just a portion of the actual underlying computer hardware.</p>
               <h4>How does virtualization work?</h4>
               <p>Software called hypervisors separate the physical resources from the virtual environments—the things that need those resources. Hypervisors can sit on top of an operating system (like on a laptop) or be installed directly onto hardware (like a server), which is how most enterprises virtualize. Hypervisors take your physical resources and divide them up so that virtual environments can use them.</p>
               <p>Resources are partitioned as needed from the physical environment to the many virtual environments. Users interact with and run computations within the virtual environment (typically called a guest machine or virtual machine). The virtual machine functions as a single data file. And like any digital file, it can be moved from one computer to another, opened in either one, and be expected to work the same.</p>
               <p>When the virtual environment is running and a user or program issues an instruction that requires additional resources from the physical environment, the hypervisor relays the request to the physical system and caches the changes—which all happens at close to native speed (particularly if the request is sent through an open source hypervisor based on KVM, the Kernel-based Virtual Machine).</p>
               <h4>What is Hypervisors?</h4>
               <p>A hypervisor is the software layer that coordinates VMs. It serves as an interface between the VM and the underlying physical hardware, ensuring that each has access to the physical resources it needs to execute. It also ensures that the VMs don’t interfere with each other by impinging on each other’s memory space or compute cycles.</p>
               <ul>There are two types of hypervisors:
                    <li>Type 1 or “bare-metal” hypervisors interact with the underlying physical resources, replacing the
                        traditional operating system altogether.
                        They most commonly appear in virtual server scenarios.
                    </li>
                    <li>Type 2 hypervisors run as an application on an existing OS. Most commonly used on endpoint devices to run
                        alternative operating systems,
                        they carry a performance overhead because they must use the host OS to access and coordinate the underlying
                        hardware resources.
                    </li>
               </ul>
               <h4>Benefits of virtualization</h4>

               <p>Resource efficiency: Before virtualization, each application server required its own dedicated physical
                        CPU—IT staff would purchase
                        and configure a separate server for each application they wanted to run. (IT preferred one application and
                        one operating system (OS) per
                        computer for reliability reasons.) Invariably, each physical server would be underused. In contrast, server
                        virtualization lets you run
                        several applications—each on its own VM with its own OS—on a single physical computer (typically an x86
                        server) without sacrificing reliability.
                        This enables maximum utilization of the physical hardware’s computing capacity.
               </p>
               <p>Easier management: Replacing physical computers with software-defined VMs makes it easier to use and manage
                        policies written in software.
                        This allows you to create automated IT service management workflows. For example, automated deployment and
                        configuration tools enable administrators
                        to define collections of virtual machines and applications as services, in software templates. This means
                        that they can install those services
                        repeatedly and consistently without cumbersome, time-consuming. and error-prone manual setup. Admins can use
                        virtualization security policies to
                        mandate certain security configurations based on the role of the virtual machine. Policies can even increase
                        resource efficiency by retiring unused
                        virtual machines to save on space and computing power.
               </p>
               <p>Minimal downtime: OS and application crashes can cause downtime and disrupt user productivity. Admins can
                        run multiple redundant virtual machines
                        alongside each other and failover between them when problems arise. Running multiple redundant physical
                        servers is more expensive.
               </p>
               <p>Faster provisioning: Buying, installing, and configuring hardware for each application is time-consuming.
                        Provided that the hardware is already
                        in place, provisioning virtual machines to run all your applications is significantly faster. You can even
                        automate it using management software and
                        build it into existing workflows.
               </p>
